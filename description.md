# Description Of School Projects

### 1. GoogleAPI's_CameraPlugins_forMobile

By using geolocation, Langitude and latitude value was acheived. After that, googleAPI key was 
utilized to in url with Lang and Lat value. These helped to findout the location and
show the Nearby restaurants in Tab1(Home).

Secocnd Tab was Camera for accessing device camera, taking picture and store on the page. Phonegap
camera plugins were used here.
Third was about Weather by getting users location. 
Fourth tab was about distance measurement. Google API was also used here so by giving two 
cities' names, distance was calculated in KMs and estimated travel time.
Fifth tab was school lunch menu that was retrieved through amica API and showing them in list format.

### 2. HTML_CSS_MartialART_Prototype

This is old fashioned static website just for making prototype of user experience project.
HTML and CSS was mainly used. 

### 3. PlanningApp_jquery_Mobile

Jquery mobile app using Jquery theme. Basically, it is an app for getting the information of current
day, weather situation, Adding Todos and daily each day expenses.

Calendar is displayed from Jquery UI, Weather Tab is for showing the weather by accessing the device
location. TodoList is a bit different than traditional todo list(where you push items in array and display) 
it is using HTML attribute and Local storage so if todo lists are saved so it remains there even
after restarting the app ever. Add Expenses tab is to input expenses and add them, it will be automatically
adding by pressing the button. If user want to clear all the expenses then clear button is there.

### 4. TodoList with HTML & Local_Storage

Simplest TodoList app with HTML and local storage. It has the same information as added in number 3.
So whenever user will open the page TODOs will be there even it was saved in local storage.
Additionally, Weather API was utlized again. Originally, this project was containing AngularJS and 
Node.js as file was coming from Node(backend) and Angular was showing the JSON text of the file
in form of Table on View. However, those were excluded in this project on github only.
